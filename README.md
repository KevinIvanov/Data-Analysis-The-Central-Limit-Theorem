# Data Analysis: The Central Limit Theorem 📈

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project delves into understanding the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) through practical data analysis. Using daily stock prices, we examine how sample means distribute and confirm the CLT's predictions about distribution shapes, means, and variances.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem**: Use real-world data to illustrate and confirm the CLT's principles.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employ statistical techniques to explore and analyze the distribution of stock prices.
- **Visualization**: Craft histograms and QQ plots to visualize the distribution behaviors of both population data and sampling distributions.

## 🔍 Methods Used
- **Histogram Analysis**: Visualizing the frequency distribution of stock prices to assess skewness and normality.
- **Sampling Techniques**: Generating multiple sample means to examine the behavior of their distribution against theoretical predictions.
- **QQ Plots**: Using Quantile-Quantile plots to assess the normality of distributions.

## 📈 Results
- The study confirms that the distribution of sample means approaches normality as predicted by the CLT, even when the population distribution is not normal.
- The means of the sampling distributions closely match the population mean, supporting the theorem's reliability in estimating population parameters.

## 📝 Conclusions
The findings bolster the validity of the Central Limit Theorem in practical applications, demonstrating its fundamental role in statistical inference and its effectiveness in predicting the behavior of sample means.
